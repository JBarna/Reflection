# Reflection

What this software does, is every 20 minutes it pops up on your screen and plays a video feed from your webcam. Two things happen:

-  You're doing work and you simply take a break for a minute until it goes away

**or** (if you're like me) the more likely scenario is

- You're suddenly confronted with the simple realization that you're completely wasting your time. You press the "shutdown" button, and go on living your life.

### Why
The internet has the ability to grab our attention even when it's not in our best interest. By being forced to look at your sorry self, you have to confront the reality that you're just sitting in front of a computer, doing nothing. 

I place a **shutdown** button right on the screen so once you've snapped back into reality, you're able to quickly shutdown your computer before it grabs your attention once again.

### How to install
[Download](https://github.com/JBarna/Reflection/releases/download/2016.1/Reflection.jar) the executable from Github. You **must** have **Java** installed on your computer for this program to work. [Download Java here](https://java.com/en/download/) if you don't have it.

### Run
Just double click it to start. 

### Run on startup
On Windows, open `run` by pressing`windows_key + r` and enter `C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup` and drop the file there.

### Notes
This program is in it's infancy and I'm looking for community feedback before I put more work into it. I have some ideas for improvement:

* Task tray icon to control program
* Set different timers (ex 10 minutes, or 30 minutes between showings)
* Select different webcam. 

Let me know what you think!
